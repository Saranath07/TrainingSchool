However, its training time is significantly longer than the other two models. Class-wise performance is also perfect for both classes.\n2. **'lstm':** This model performs moderately well, with an accuracy of 0.6 and macro F1-score of 0.5833. Its class-wise performance shows some imbalance, with class 0 achieving better precision and recall than class 1.
